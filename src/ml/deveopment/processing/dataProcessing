The following are potentially useful
    MRegularSeasonDetailedResults - lots of stats about regular season games, useful for advanced modelling
    MSampleSubmissionStage1 - example of how to submit results to Kaggle competition
    MSecondaryTourneyCompactResults - Good for testing non-March Madness games
    MNCAATourneyDetailedResults

The following files are useful
    MMasseyOrdinals - Rankings Data, main independent var
    MNCAATourneyCompactResults - Tournament Results, good for testing
    MRegularSeasonCompactResults - regular season results, independent variable for training
    MTeams - ties teamIDs to Team Names

_______
rankings
-------
Description:
    Includes third-party rankings of each team.
    Very useful but has some limitations:
        a) uses someone else's input, not my own
        b) Ordinal ranks but does nothing to indicate magnitude
    None the less, this can be very useful and building a basic model

Raw File:
    MMasseyOrdinals.csv

Transformations:
    Transform from long to wide
    handle NULL values (probably row-wise deletion)
    Rename columns
    Save to CSV

Output File(s):
    team_rankings.csv

----------------------
Regular Season Results
----------------------
Description:
    Lists every regular season game, their game number, the year and winning/losing team IDs

Raw File:
    MNCAATourneyCompactResults

Transformations:
    Rename columns
    Add "win_ind" column
    drop unneeded columns
    subset to two different dataframes: only winners and only losers. Then append them together
# this is probably the most controversial decision in this entire modelling processing

Output File(s):
    regular_season_games.csv
