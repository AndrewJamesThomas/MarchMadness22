rankings
-------
Description:
    Includes third-party rankings of each team.
    Very useful but has some limitations:
        a) uses someone else's input, not my own
        b) Ordinal ranks but does nothing to indicate magnitude
    None the less, this can be very useful and building a basic model

Raw File:
    MMasseyOrdinals.csv

Transformations:
    Transform from long to wide
    Rename columns
    handle dtypes as needed
    handle NULL values (probably row-wise deletion)
    Save to CSV

Output File(s):
    team_rankings.csv
